# cal-ai

Not much as of right now, but to run the programs go to the tests folder.

Plugin system was my attempt at trying to recreate [Plugify](plugify.net), then wrapped with a voice assistant.

To check if plugin system is working:
```
python -m tests.plugin_test
```

To check if the assistant is working:
```
python -m tests.cal_test
```

Doesn't even work right now because the plugins won't load for some reason but it's only the first version so it's fine. Expect breaking changes.
