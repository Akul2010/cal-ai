# cal-ai

Not much as of right now, but to run the programs go to the tests folder.

This project was my attempt at trying to recreate [Plugify](plugify.net), but then I later slapped a voice assistant on it (with heavy modifications of course).

To check if plugin system is working:
```
python -m tests.plugin_test
```

To check if the assistant is working:
```
python -m tests.cal_test
```
